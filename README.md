# pegjs-override-action

Override action ([PEGjs](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs) plugin)

## Reason

This plugin came to life, as part of a process of referencing basic PEGs and build structure outside of the PEGs. In essence, it gives the possibility for reusable PEGs.

E.g. [A collection of core PEGjs grammars (RFC, ISO, etc.)](https://github.com/andreineculau/core-pegjs)
